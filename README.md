Implement of String functions using array and pointer

The C programming environment contains a standard library. The facilities provided in the standard library are declared in interface (alias header, alias .h) files. One of those interface files is string.h; it contains the declarations of string handling functions, that is, functions that perform operations on character strings. 

This repository is to compose a Str module that contains versions of the most commonly used standard string handling functions, including getLength(), copy(), concat(), compare() and search(). The hahaves of these functions are the same as the corresponsiding standard C functions: strlen,strcpy,strcat,strcmp,strstr.

Two implementation approarches are used for the above functions: 1) array approach which uses arrary notation as much as possible; 2) pointer approach which uses pointer notation as much as possible. 

This project is a COS217 assignment. https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr23/cos217/asgts/02str/index.html

A complete code is a private repository and it is available upon request only for employment purpose.
